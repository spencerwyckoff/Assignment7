Q: Show me how to calculate the average price of all items. Please console.log the average.

A: The average price is $23.62

What do we know???? 
-var items is an array of 25 objects
-Within each object, there are roughly 40 different properties

My Thought Process for Exercise 1:
	-I want to create a new array that just shows the price property for each of the 25 different objects.
			**For this I think I want to use the map() method....

	-Then I want to take each of those price values and convert them to numerals.
	-Then I want to add all of those values together.
			**Realized we can use the reduce() method to do this...
	-Then I want to divide that total by the total (.length)
	-Then I want to return the answer in a string "The average price is " + (answer)""
========================================================================*/
var priceArray = items.map( function (item, i, array) {
	return item.price;
});

var priceSum = priceArray.reduce( function (a, b) {
	return (a + b);
});	

var priceAvg = priceSum / items.length;
var priceString = priceAvg.toString();
var trimmedPrice = priceString.substring(0, 5)

console.log("The average price is $" + priceAvg.toFixed(2) + " by using the .toFixed(2) method at the end...");

console.log("The average price is $" + trimmedPrice + " --- only if I convert it to a string first, then use the .substring method to trim it to the first 5 characters.");

Q: Show me how to get an array of items that cost between $14.00 and $18.00 USD

A: "Items that cost between $14.00 USD and $18.00 USD:"
[
{
  title: "1970s Coors Banquet Glass Beer Pitcher",
  ...
},
{
  title: "The Three Broomsticks Customizable Beer Stein Mug, Harry Potter Inspired, hogsmeade village, harry potter gift, three broomsticks mug",
  ...
},
{
  title: "Hand Painted Colorful Feather Glass",
  ...
}
]
Initial Thought Process for #2: WRONG!!!!!
	-Use map() method to grab the title property for each object
	-Use priceArray from earlier and create an if statement that measures the prices between $14-18.  
	-"console.log(Items that cost between...)" 
		console.log (titlesArray_14_18)
========================================================================*/
var pricesArray_14_18 = function (item) {
	return item.price >= 14 && item.price <= 18;
}; 

var filtered = items.filter(pricesArray_14_18);

console.log("Items that cost between $14.00 USD and $18.00 USD:")

filtered.forEach( function (item) {
	console.log("title: " + item.title);
});

Q: Show me how find the item with a "GBP" currency code and print its name and price. Please console.log the one you find.

A: 1970s Schlitz Malt Liquor Glass Beer Pitcher costs Â£18

Initial Thought Process for #3:

========================================================================*/
var GBP = function (item) {
	return item.currency_code === "GBP";
}

var GBP_filtered = items.filter(GBP);

GBP_filtered.forEach( function (item) {
	console.log(item.title + " costs " + String.fromCharCode('163') + item.price);
});

Q: Show me how to find which items are made of wood. Please console.log the ones you find.

A: SALE Mid Century Siesta Ware White Mug with Anchor - Set of 3 is made of wood.
Bottle cap catcher personalized. Man cave gift for him- Wooden Beer pub sign - Groomsmen wedding Gift is made of wood.
Medium Size, Welcome To Our Firepit-Where Friends And Marshmallows Get Toasted At The Same Time-Painted Wood Sign-Custom Colors is made of wood.
Magnetic Wall Mount Bottle Opener Barware Set - Stainless Steel or Black - Personalized if you like! is made of wood.
Engraved Pocket Knife, Personalized Groomsmen Gift, Ring Bearer Gift, Graduation Gift, 4 Knives is made of wood.

Thought process for #4:
	-wood is under the .materials property
	-we will also need the .title property for the final answer
	-I need to create a filter that looks through each object and sees if the .materials property includes "wood"
	-Once I have that new filtered list, I need to console.log the filteredlist.title

========================================================================*/
var materialsArray = items.filter(function (item) {
	return item.materials.indexOf("wood") > -1;
});

materialsArray.forEach (function (item) {
 console.log (item.title + " is made of wood.");
});

Thought Process for #5:
	-The answer needs a title and materials
	-Filter the items array so that we get materials and that there are >= 8 materials
	-console.log the title property and list the materials
========================================================================*/
var manyMaterials = items.filter( function (item) {
		return item.materials.length >= 8;
});

var logManyMaterials = manyMaterials.forEach (function (item, i, array) {
	console.log(item.title + " has " + item.materials.length + " materials: " + item.materials);
});
